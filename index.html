Scrambled Eggs
Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
Ingredients
•	2 eggs
•	1tbs butter
•	2tbs cream
Method
1.	Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat
2.	Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl
3.	Once butter has melted add cream and eggs
4.	Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)
5.	When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)
